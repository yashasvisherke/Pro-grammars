AI-based web platform that conducts simulated interviews with 3D avatars. Users can select the topics of interview (e.g., Technology, HR), levels of difficulty, interviewers, and adjust the number of panelists. The difficulty level of questions is adapted dynamically according to the user's face expressions and the session is recorded as a whole for assessment and feedback. This is built to give an adaptive and realistic experience of interview preparation.
